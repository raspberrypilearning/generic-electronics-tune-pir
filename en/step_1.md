When you first connect your PIR, you need to leave it for about a minute, so that it can settle.

To tune a PIR, you need to understand three basic adjustable areas of the PIR.

### Sensitivity
- **Sensitivity** can be adjusted so that the PIR will pick up motion at different distances. Fully clockwise and it will pick up motion up to about 3 metres away. Fully anticlockwise and it will pick up motion up to about 7 metres away.

### Delay time
- **Delay time** is the amount of time that the PIR will signal for, once it is triggered. This is adjustable from about 3 seconds up to about 300 seconds. You are probably best having this potentiometer turned fully anti-clockwise to keep the trigger time to a minimum.

### Trigger Jumper
- The trigger jumper can be set to two positions. In the diagram above, it is set to **single trigger**. In this mode the PIR will signal once when it detects motion, and not signal again if a second motion is detected within the delay time.
- If you move the jumper, it will be set to **repeat trigger**. This means that the PIR will be triggered when it detects motion. If it detects motion again within the delay time, it will trigger again, and the delay time will be reset.
- Most of the time you want to be using the PIR in **repeat trigger** mode.
